#### Bird API

The /birds route needs changing to return the bird data from public/data.json in alphabetical order.

Complete the route, and add a test in `src\test\routes\birds.spec.ts`, to check whether its in alphabetical order or not.

Create a website with Create-React-App in typescript to display the birds as shown below. The site should be coded with function components and css / scss modules. The header and footer should both be sticky.
